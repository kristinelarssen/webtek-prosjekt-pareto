    <p>
        Our client is the student organization Pareto, which is the student
        Organisation for economics and financial economy at NTNU in
        Trondheim. Pareto is responsible for arranging social events for
        all the students. This includes tips, Parties, quizzes and other
        happenings throughout the semester. They do not have a website,
        so all their information has to go through other channels, like
        Facebook, instagram and stands at the campus. This can be
        a bit chaotic with information coming from so many
        different places. Therefore we would like to make a
        website for them where they can share all their information
        and it can be easily accessed.
